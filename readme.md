### 🚩 Question Number 1
1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

### Answer 👇

**getElementById:** Finds an element with a specific ID. It always returns only one element (because an ID should be unique).
**getElementsByClassName:** Finds all elements with the same class name.
**querySelector:** Works like a CSS selector (e.g., class, id, or tag). It only returns the first matched element.
**querySelectorAll:** Similar to querySelector, but returns all the matched elements.
