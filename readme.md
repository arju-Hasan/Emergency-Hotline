## 🖐 Hi, I'm Arju. This is my Answer Readme.md File.

### 🚩 Question Number 1
1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

### Answer 👇

<u>**getElementById:**</u> Finds an element with a specific ID. It always returns only one element (because an ID should be unique).

<u>**getElementsByClassName:**</u> Finds all elements with the same class name.

<u>**querySelector:**</u> Works like a CSS selector (e.g., class, id, or tag). It only returns the first matched element.

<u>**querySelectorAll:**</u> Similar to querySelector, but returns all the matched elements.



### 🚩 Question Number 2
2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

### Answer 👇
To add a new element to the DOM, first you need to create an element, then place it inside another element.


### 🚩 Question Number 3
3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

### Answer 👇
Event bubbling is a process in browser event handling where when an event occurs on a child element, it gradually propagates “upward” to the parent elements. That is, Child → Parent → Parent → Parent → Parent.


### 🚩 Question Number 4
4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

### Answer 👇
Event delegation is implemented inside an event listener on a parent element so that the events of its child elements can also be handled.


### 🚩 Question Number 5
5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

### Answer 👇
**preventDefault():** Stops the default browser behavior of an event.
**stopPropagation():** Prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
