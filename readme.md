### 🚩 Question Number 1
1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

### Answer 👇

<u>**getElementById:**</u> Finds an element with a specific ID. It always returns only one element (because an ID should be unique).
<u>**getElementsByClassName:**</u> Finds all elements with the same class name.
<u>**querySelector:**</u> Works like a CSS selector (e.g., class, id, or tag). It only returns the first matched element.
<u>**querySelectorAll:**</u> Similar to querySelector, but returns all the matched elements.
